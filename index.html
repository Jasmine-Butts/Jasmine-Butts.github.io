        <strong> About Me:</strong><br>
        <br>
        I'm studying Computer Science at the University of North Carolina - Greensboro, with a special interest in cybersecurity. I also study Communications as my minor. I discovered my love for tech during my sophomore year of high school after taking my first Java class. Since then, I've been eager to learn and immerse myself in the vast tech world. </p>
